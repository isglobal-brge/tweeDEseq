Description: Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq using the
        Poisson-Tweedie (PT) family of distributions. PT distributions are described
        by a mean, a dispersion and a shape parameter and include Poisson and NB
        distributions, among others, as particular cases. An important feature of this
        family is that, while the Negative Binomial (NB) distribution only allows a
        quadratic mean-variance relationship, the PT distributions generalizes this
        relationship to any orde.
